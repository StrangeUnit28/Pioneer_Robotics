# Robotics Project - Assignment 1

This repository contains all the deliverables and implementation related to Assignment 1 of the Robotics course.

The project includes Python scripts for simulating and controlling a mobile robot (Pioneer P3-DX) inside CoppeliaSim, using PID-based navigation and discrete motion based on a 0.5m grid.

## Contents

- Python controller code
- PID tuning and trajectory logic
- Simulation connection via remote API (CoppeliaSim)
- Grid navigation strategies

## Objective

The objective is to navigate a mobile robot through a defined environment using only discrete movements — forward, left turn, and right turn — to reach predefined goal positions located on the grid.
